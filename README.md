# Enigma

## Learning Goals / Areas of Focus

- Practice breaking a program into logical components
- Build classes that demonstrate single responsibilities
- Test drive a well-designed Object Oriented solution
- Work with file i/o


## Overview

In this project I will use Ruby to build a tool for cracking an encryption algorithm. An initial understanding of the the Encryption Algorithm is needed, to plan out what classes will be needed prior to starting.
